# Overview

waterfall is the Vault for your games. _Just don't break the water chip._

The most elegant way to explain what waterfall is this:
> What Jellyfin is to Netflix, waterfall is to Steam.

## Goal
A simple game library manager that allows you to install games directly or through Lutris by connecting it to a waterfall instance.
You can download through the bittorrent protocol or regularly.
You will be able to download and manage:
+ **Games**
    + You can install the game files directly
    + Or a executable Installer
    + You can also install different versions of a game.
    + You can also provide and utilise a Lutris script for a game so that Lutris can automatically set the game up up.
+ **Patches**
    + Patches can include DLCs
    + But also Mods
    + or even bug fixes
## Interesting things
### FiSHUsI
FiSHUsI is a very common way to do things. I'm confident that every developer knows what it is.
But just in case I'll explain it.

**FiSHUsI** stands for:

**Fi**le **S**ystem **H**ierarchy as **Us**er **I**nterface.

In waterfall's case it means that all organising is done through the restructuring the File Hierarchy.
